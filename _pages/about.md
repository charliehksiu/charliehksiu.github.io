I am an independent researcher working in philosophy of language, with special interests in loose talk, relevance, questions, and fiction.

I did my BA at the University of Hong Kong, MA at Texas A&M University, and PhD at Brown University. I previously taught at Sun Yat-sen University, Hong Kong Community College, Hong Kong Baptist University, and Texas A&M University.

Here is my [cv](../assets/cv2025.pdf).
