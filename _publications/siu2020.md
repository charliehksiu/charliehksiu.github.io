A standard objection to Cappelen and Leporeâ€™s (2005) Semantic Minimalism is that minimal propositions are explanatorily idle. But Schoubye and Stokke (2016) recently proposed that minimal proposition and the question under discussion of a conversation jointly determine what is said in a systematic and explanatory way. This note argues that their account both overgenerates and undergenerates.
